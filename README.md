# Text Query Manipulator for Improved Detection

This repository contains an experiment aimed at enhancing the performance of a text query-based detection model using an NLP-based manipulator. The manipulator is designed to modify the user's text query in such a way that the detection results are improved. The training of this manipulator is implemented using the "trl" library, which facilitates training with either human feedback or the IoU (Intersection over Union) metric evaluation.

## Introduction

The main objective of this experiment is to explore the potential of NLP-based manipulation techniques in enhancing the performance of a text-based detection model. By iteratively improving the input query, the expectation is to achieve better detection results for various tasks, such as object detection or text-based image retrieval.

## Installation

To set up the environment and dependencies required to run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

The experiment consists of three main parts: training the detection model, training the NLP-based manipulator with reward modeling, and training the NLP-based manipulator using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) tuning.

### Training the Detection Model

To train the detection model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the Dataset:
   - Ensure that you have the dataset ready for your specific detection task.
   - Organize the data in a format compatible with the model training script.

2. Train the Model:
   - Use the relevant detection model implementation and train it on your dataset.
   - Save the trained model checkpoint for later evaluation.

### Training the NLP-based Manipulator with Reward Modeling

To train the NLP-based manipulator using reward modeling, proceed as follows:

1. Prepare the Manipulator Dataset:
   - Generate a dataset of text queries and corresponding rewards (feedback) based on the detection model's performance.
   - Ensure that the rewards represent the quality of detection results for each modified query.

2. Train the Manipulator:
   - Utilize the "trl" library to train the manipulator using the reward dataset.
   - Adjust the hyperparameters as needed based on your experiment's requirements.
   - Save the trained manipulator model checkpoint.

### Training the NLP-based Manipulator with PPO Tuning

To train the NLP-based manipulator using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) tuning, proceed as follows:

1. Prepare the Manipulator Dataset:
   - Generate a dataset of text queries and their corresponding rewards by evaluating them with the detection model.
   - The rewards should be based on the detection model's performance for each modified query.

2. Train the Manipulator:
   - Utilize the "trl" library and PPO algorithm to train the manipulator on the reward dataset.
   - Adjust the hyperparameters as needed based on your experiment's requirements.
   - Save the trained manipulator model checkpoint.

## Running the Models

After training the detection model and the NLP-based manipulators, you can run them for evaluation or real-world use.

1. Evaluation:
   - Load the trained detection model and manipulator models.
   - Use the manipulator to modify text queries for the evaluation dataset.
   - Evaluate the performance of the enhanced detection results using appropriate metrics.

2. Real-world Use:
   - Load the trained detection model and manipulator models.
   - Integrate the manipulator into your text query-based detection system.
   - Use the manipulator to preprocess user queries before passing them to the detection model for real-world use.
